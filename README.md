# üåê LOCALE

*LOcalisation of the Clinical triAls template fiLes with site-specific valuEs and site logo*
*v0.1.0*

*LOCALE* is a collection of tools to help coordination teams and participating sites to automate the updates needed for various templates and documents. You can either use the tools running the `python` files in the `streamlit` folder or use the same tools in the browser running the `html` counterpart in the `stlite` folder.

## Current tools

* Coordination tool 
* Participating site tool

## How does it work?

**Coordination** team must create a localisation package for participating sites. This package include the following:

1. Template files: in docx format (all docx should have a placeholder logo for site's to replace)
2. Placeholder logo: The placeholder used in templates files should also be added to the zip package separately as *LOCALE* will use image recognition to find and replace the placeholder logo in the template files.
3. 'localisation.csv' file: a CSV file that includes all documents and all variables in each document. Since typing it manually can be error-prone and tedious, *LOCALE* provides "Coordination tool" to generate this file from the provided Word documents.

**Participating site** then can use this zip package to update the variables in the templates, upload their site logo, and finally download the localised documents.
